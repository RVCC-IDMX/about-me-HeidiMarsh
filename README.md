# Project Description
### This website is meant to act as a portfolio of sorts, highlighting my skills as a beginning web developer, as well as skills outside of web development. This project has taught me many different things in the realm of coding, and are as follows:

-	Common commands and rules within code
-	How GitHub and Netlify can make creating a webpage easier
-	How HTML and CSS work together
-	The importance of file names
-	Choosing a color scheme that has a high contrast for visually impaired users
-	How to embed images and videos onto your webpage
-	The importance of using royalty free media
-	How the Inspector and Dev Tools works, and how it can aid in the coding process
-	The Box Model, and how that can add to your webpage
-	Responsive design and its importance
-	Media Queries
-	How to create tables and forms that are easily accessible
-	How to code a navigation bar
-	How to code links to areas within the webpage
-	How to code a hamburger menu
-	How to troubleshoot problems that arise
-	Why mobile first is an easier way to create a responsive webpage

### Color Scheme

 One of the two background colors is: `#D6D0C1` or `rgb(214, 208, 193)` 
 The second that alternates with the previous is: `#B6C4D6` or `rgb(182, 196, 214)`
 The borders are `#6E708A` or `rgb(110, 112, 138)` 
 The text colors, hamburger menu, and contact form outlines are all`#315B8F`or `rgb(49, 91, 143)`


### NavBar

The navbar on this site was created using HTML and CSS. The code for it can be found in my index.html document, as well as my nav.css document. The hamburger menu was also coded using the same languages and the code for it can also be found in the same documents. Following the instructions from this link, [Create a responsive navigation nav with no JS! - YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA), I was able to create a simple menu that shows which links the user can reach on my page.
