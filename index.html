        <h2> Scalable Vector Graphics </h2>

        <div>

           <p> So, what exactly is a scalable vector graphic? Abbreviated SVG, scalable vector graphics do not rely on pixels the way other files such as JPG and PNGs do. JPGs and PNGs are known as raster images, and rely heavily on pixels. SVGs rely on geometric mathematical equations to form images. Because they are made from geometric mathematic equations rather than pixels, they can be scaled to any size and still retain the image quality. If one were to look at an SVG file in an editor such as Adobe Illustrator, they would find that instead of the image being one entity like a raster image would be, an SVG image is made up of anchor points. Anchor points surround an SVG image and they demonstrate how a line exits and enters one of these points. They show the edges of a picture and allow one to manipulate the image in a way that raster images cannot be manipulated.</p>
           <p> In addition to retaining image quality, scalable vector graphics also have the advantage of smaller file sizes than other image types. This can be incredibly helpful when working on a project with many files that can slow things down on one’s computer. SVGs also can be placed right in code, and can even be created in code, which is just another advantage over raster images. It can be embedded into one’s code like any other image file, but if one does not already have an image to embed, it can simply be created using a code editor. </p>
           <p> Scalable vector images can simply be created in a CSS file. Using a “viewBox” attribute within an SVG tag, one can set a frame around their image and create shapes with different colors, borders, etc., just like they would with any other element on their page. The “path” element is an important part of coding an SVG image, especially if a developer wishes to create an image that is not only made up of simple shapes such as rectangles, circles, squares, etc. Using the “d” attribute, which stands for draw, one can, in fact, “draw” using code. The “M” command represents how one would move a drawing utensil across a page. By typing in x and y coordinates, this “pen” knows where to move. A capital “M” represents absolute, whilst a lowercase “m” represents continuing from the last point. To actually create a line, quite obviously, one has to use the line attribute, which is abbreviated “L”. “C” and “Q” commands allow for the user to create rounded lines, as the “L” command only offers straight lines.</p>
           <p> If a developer does not wish to go through all the steps required to create an SVG image from scratch within their CSS code, there is always the option to convert an existing image into an SVG file. There are a handful of software programs that are able to do this easily, as well as other online tools that one need not download. </p>
           <p> One caveat of scalable vector graphics is that it is best to only use simple images with clean lines when converting them. Complex images with lots of details most likely will not turn out as well as a simpler image would. </p>
           <p> Overall, SVGs can be very helpful when developing a website, as they are smaller files than raster images, and are able to be scaled up and down while retaining their resolution.</p>
